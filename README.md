# 💸 Simulated Digital Banking System for Secure Transactions

## **Created for Charles Schwab Interview (NOT AFFILIATED WITH CHARLES SCHWAB AT ALL - JUST A PROJECT TO SHOWCASE)**

A full-stack banking simulation platform where users can create accounts, perform secure transactions, and sign high-value envelopes (> $10,000) for verification.
Built with Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL, the project demonstrates JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and a modern responsive UI — containerized using Docker.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Node.js 18+
- MySQL 8.0+
- (optional) Docker Desktop

## Usage

### Build using Docker
> docker compose up --build

To Stop:
> docker compose down

Go To: http://localhost:4200

If you want to just test locally instead, just follow the following directions 👇

### Set Up Backend

1. Build backend
> cd transaction_validator

and set your database credentials in:
> src/main/resources/application.properties

Example:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/transaction_validator
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

2. Start backend
> mvn spring-boot:run
Now the app will begin to run on http://localhost:8080 or if you want to use Swagger, try http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

### Set Up Frontend

1. Build and Start Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

2. Test
Now the frontend will begin to run on http://localhost:4200

## 🧾 Example Use Flow
1. Sign up → automatically creates user
2. Log in → retrieves JWT token (saved in localStorage)
3. Create account → initial deposit
4. Send a transaction:
    - If ≤ $10,000 → auto-approved
    - If > $10,000 → generates envelope requiring signatures
5. Both users sign → funds transferred + envelope marked “COMPLETED”
